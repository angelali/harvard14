  0: "The graduating Harvard College Class of 2014 counts among its numbers dozens of soon-to-be-employed bankers, coders, and engineers — but women will be underrepresented and underpaid in each of these fields. Two-fifths of the class has sought mental health support, and TK fraction of non-white or multiracial students say they have felt marginalized because of their race during their time at Harvard — yet seniors are nearly unanimous in the view that, if given the chance, they would choose Harvard again.<p>This portrait of the Class of 2014 comes from The Crimson’s annual survey of the graduating senior class. Nearly half of the class — 762 graduating seniors — responded to an email survey conducted from May 13 to May 20, though not all of them completed the survey. Questions ranged from post-graduation plans to the issues that dominated campus and national conversation during the Class of 2014’s time at Harvard. The Crimson did not adjust the survey data for any possible self-selection bias.",
  1: "When asked about their plans for their first year out of college, 70 percent of seniors said they will join the workforce, 18 percent will attend graduate school, 4 percent will travel, and the remaining 8 percent are undecided. Half of the class will stay said they will stay in the northeast after graduation, and 17 percent said they will move out west.<p>Employed seniors reported a median starting salary of between $50,000 and $69,999, while 11 percent of employed seniors will earn $90,000 or more. Nationwide, graduates of the Class of 2014 can expect to earn an average starting salary of about $45,000, according to a recent report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers.<p>The lucrative finance and consulting industries will employ 31 percent of working seniors, a statistic that has stayed somewhat steady in the past several years after falling sharply between 2007 and 2009 as corporate recruiters reduced hiring numbers at the height of the recession. The technology and engineering sector was the second most popular industry among working seniors this year, drawing 15 percent of those entering the workforce. Another nine percent of workers said they plan to go into public service or nonprofit work.<p>Despite their popularity, some of these industries draw unevenly from Harvard’s male and female graduates — and compensate them unequally as well. Working men were more than twice as likely as their female counterparts to report that they would be going into finance, nearly twice as likely to say they would be entering the technology or engineering industry, and half as likely to say they were going into the public service or nonprofit sector. Consulting, however, attracted a nearly equal percentage of working senior men and women.<p>With the exception of public service and nonprofit work, men were overrepresented in the higher starting salary income brackets, and women were overrepresented in the lower ones. Overall, men were more likely than women to be represented in the higher income brackets. Nineteen percent of employed men said they will make a starting salary of $90,000 or more, compared to 4 percent of employed women.",
  2: "The Class of 2014 has often been heralded for its multifaceted diversity, and by many metrics, the survey results lend credence to these claims. Survey data largely corresponded with the College’s published demographic figures, while also showing that the Class of 2014 boasts a wide array of family income brackets, religious backgrounds, and sexual identities.<p>In some cases, diversity even increased during the Class of 2014’s four years on campus. Within a class that saw the establishment of Harvard’s first Office for BGLTQ Student Life and the hiring of the first director to lead it, 15 percent of respondents said they now identify as homosexual, bisexual, questioning, or other — up from 11 percent prior to Harvard.<p>Yet among some segments of the class, similarities were more pronounced than differences. White students were three times more likely than their non-white or multiracial counterparts to report that they were Harvard legacies; one-fifth of white students said they had at least one parent who attended Harvard, compared to 7 percent of non-white or multiracial students.<p>Some surveyed seniors also said they did not always feel comfortable on campus. In a year in which the “I, Too, Am Harvard” project sparked discussion about “microaggressions” on college campuses as far away as Oxford, TK percent of non-white or multiracial seniors reported having felt marginalized because of their race during their time at Harvard. That figure includes more than half of surveyed black or African American seniors.",
  3: "With a massive cheating scandal and the recent approval of Harvard’s first-ever honor code, academic dishonesty dominated the conversation around academics during the Class of 2014’s time at Harvard.<p>Nearly two years after the Government 1310 cheating scandal, 17 percent of surveyed seniors said they had cheated during their academic careers at Harvard. Just 15 percent of all respondents admitted to cheating on a homework assignment or a problem set — less than half of the rate reported in a similar survey of the Class of 2013. Six percent of this year’s surveyed seniors said they had cheated on a paper or a take home exam, or on an in-class exam, rates comparable to last year’s survey results.<p>Seniors were much more likely to suspect cheating among their peers than to admit to cheating themselves. On average, surveyed seniors guessed that 53 percent of the class had cheated on a homework assignment or a problem set, 32 percent on a paper or take-home exam, and 14 percent on an in-class exam.<p>While the newly approved honor code will go into effect long after the Class of 2014 has left Harvard, just 12 percent of surveyed seniors said an honor code would have changed the way they approached academic integrity during their time as Harvard students.<p>Beyond just academic integrity, other factors played a role in seniors’ academic experiences at Harvard. In a year that saw national conversation about the role of socioeconomic status in unevenly preparing students to succeed in college, surveyed seniors reported GPAs that roughly increased alongside their reported family income.",
  4: "From student activism to administrative reforms, the issues of mental health and sexual assault have loomed large during the Class of 2014’s time at Harvard.<p>Forty-two percent of seniors said they have sought some form of mental health support in college. By way of comparison, two recent surveys have found that about 10 percent of students at four-year institutions of higher education seek help for mental health issues.<p>Harvard seniors who identify as BGLTQ were more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to seek mental health support from University Health Services, the Bureau of Student Counsel, off-campus professionals, and peer counseling groups. In particular, BGLTQ respondents were twice as likely as heterosexual respondents to report having sought mental health support from UHS, and four times as likely to say they had turned to a peer counseling group regarding mental health issues.<p>Seniors’ satisfaction with counseling services for mental health issues varied widely. Three quarters of surveyed seniors who sought help from at least one off-campus professional said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the help they received, compared to just 42 percent of those who went to UHS for mental health support. UHS also had the highest disapproval rating among the four listed counseling services, with 37 percent of respondents who went to UHS saying they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the help they received.<p>When asked about their personal experiences with sexual violence, 12 percent of women said they had been sexually assaulted at Harvard, compared to 2 percent of men. Just 16 percent of these victims reported their assault. By way of comparison, a 2007 study found that 19 percent of college women at large four-year universities experienced an attempted or completed sexual assault during their undergraduate careers. Some researchers estimate that 95 percent of sexual assaults on college campuses may go unreported.",
  5: "The Class of 2014 attended Harvard during an eventful four years on campus; they lived through the return of ROTC and the early action admissions program, a massive cheating scandal and a controversial email search, the launch of a more than $1 billion House renewal project and a $6.5 capital campaign to help fund it, and the replacement of two College deans.<p>When asked to evaluate the institution’s leaders and initiatives, surveyed seniors were sometimes divided in their opinions. Take, for instance, University President Drew G. Faust, who received a 48 percent approval rating from graduating seniors after leading Harvard for all four of the Class of 2014’s years on campus.  <p>Surveyed seniors had no trouble reaching consensus, however, regarding outgoing interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, who emphasized communication with undergraduates while heading the College this past year. Pfister enjoyed an 87 percent approval rating among seniors, compared to the 14 percent approval rating of former College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, who led the undergraduate body for the Class of 2014’s first three years at Harvard.<p>University programs and positions also saw uneven support. Surveyed seniors were cool towards the soon-to-be-overhauled Adminstrative Board, with just 13 percent saying they approved of Harvard’s disciplinary body. And although only Quincy seniors had the opportunity to experience the dividends of House Renewal, three-fifths of respondents said they approved of Harvard’s plan. Perhaps most divisive of all was the hotly debated question of whether Harvard should divest its endowment from investments in fossil fuel companies; 44 percent of respondents said they supported divestment, 24 percent opposed it, and 32 percent said they were unsure.<p>Yet despite their inconsisent evaulations of Harvard’s adminstrators and programs, surveyed seniors reached near consensus on whether they would do it all again: 92 percent said they would again pick Harvard.",
  6: "When members of the Class of 2014 weren’t busy studying, they were often involved in extracurricular activities — only some of which found a place on their resumes.<p>Drinking was a popular choice: 44 percent of surveyed seniors said they drink twice a week or more. That percentage jumped significantly among seniors who belonged to a social organization — 60 percent of women in a female final club or a sorority, and 81 percent of men in a male final club or fraternity, said they drink at least twice a week.<p>A smaller percentage of the Class of 2014 reported using drugs regularly. A quarter of respondents said they use marijuana more than once a semester, and 13 percent said they have ever tried hard drugs.<p>Self-reported sexual history also varied widely. Respondents reported a median of one dating partner and a median of two sexual partners during their time at Harvard. Twenty-one percent of the class said they were virgins, while 12 percent said they had had 10 or more sexual partners during college.<p>Surveyed seniors — particularly men — also found time for online porn. Forty-eight percent of surveyed men reported watching porn multiple times a week. In contrast, just 5 percent of women said they watched porn that frequently, and 59 percent said they had never viewed porn at all.",
  7: "Massachusetts is well known as a deep blue state, and the Class of 2014’s turf in Cambridge has proved no exception: 59 percent of surveyed seniors characterized themselves as liberal or very liberal. That number, however, drops significantly among seniors going into finance — only a quarter of soon-to-be-employed bankers said they lean leftward.<p>Graduating seniors also spent their entire college career with Barack Obama in the White House, and they are overwhelmingly supportive of their president and his policies. Eighty percent of respondents voted to reelect Obama in 2012, and now, even as his national favorability ratings hover in the mid-40s, Obama can still count on a 72 percent approval rating among surveyed Harvard seniors. And while Obama’s overhaul of the national health care system faces approval ratings in the low 40s among the American public, the Affordable Care Act enjoys a 66 percent favorability rating within the Class of 2014.<p>Other contested issues that have gained mainstream political capital over the past four years proved popular among surveyed seniors. Ninety percent of respondents — including 59 percent of Harvard’s self-identified conservatives — said they felt favorably about same-sex marriage. And 62 percent said they support marijuana legalization, a figure that jumps to 91 percent among surveyed seniors who use marijuana at least twice a semester.<p>Harvard also has its fair share of political alumni with controversial pasts — a club that could grow if any members of the Class of 2014 enter politics. Among respondents who envision themselves working in government or politics in 10 years, two-fifths admitted to having used marijuana, and 7 percent admitted to having cheated in academics."
